Today's websites are bloated, slow, and full of scripts, ads, and trackers. This
became so commonplace that we lost all sense of perspective, to the point that
we now think multi-megabyte webpages are normal.

Let's change this, one website at a time! **Hugo Simple** is a
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) and
[Hugo Bear](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) that takes care of speed and
optimization, so you can focus on writing good content.

It is free, multilingual, optimized for search engines, no-nonsense, responsive,
light, and fast. Really fast.
