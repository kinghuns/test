程序员的大航海时代

Today's websites are bloated, slow, and full of scripts, ads, and trackers. This
became so commonplace that we lost all sense of perspective, to the point that
we now think multi-megabyte webpages are normal.


>太史公曰：《诗》有之：“高山仰止，景行行止。”虽不能至，然心乡往之。
余读孔氏书，想见其为人。适鲁，观仲尼庙堂车服礼器，诸生以时习礼其家，余祗回留之不能去云。
天下君王至于贤人众矣，当时则荣，没则已焉。
孔子布衣，传十余世，学者宗之。自天子王侯，中国言《六艺》者折中于夫子，可谓至圣矣！
—— 《史记》. 司马迁

Let's change this, one website at a time! **Hugo Simple** is a
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) and
[Hugo Bear](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) that takes care of speed and
optimization, so you can focus on writing good content.

It is free, multilingual, optimized for search engines, no-nonsense, responsive,
light, and fast. Really fast.
